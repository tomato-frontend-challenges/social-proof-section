## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology

### What I learned

- The scope of a Grid container is limited to a parent-child relationship [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45536537/centering-in-css-grid). What this means is that you can't set Grid properties to the children of a Grid item and expect it to work.


### Continued development

I still don't feel fully comfortable with Grid, got to keep practicing!

Did you guys know I can very easily forget to set the *box-sizing* of a container to **border-box**? Because I just spent a while figuring out spacing issues due to this dumb mistake!

### Useful resources

- [Complete guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - CSS-Tricks never fails.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Most trustable source of documentation.
